### Tooling
1. React
2. Redux
3. Thunk
4. Ant
5. Lodash
6. SASS

### Notes
1. Added a small current-page indicator next to the pagination.
2. When using the filter dropdowns the pagination jumps automagically to page 1, so as to avoid errors caused when the filtering yields fewer pages.
3. Sports responsive layout.
4. Used local `.eslintrc` file; the create-react-app linter was perfectly fine with it :D
5. Opted for smaller reusable components.
6. Designed with extendability in mind.

### Todos
1. Add test suite.
2. Install and lint with [Airbnb styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
